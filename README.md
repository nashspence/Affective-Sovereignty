# Affective Sovereignty

This repository hosts notes on a hypothetical agent architecture. The main specification now lives in [Affective-Sovereignty.tex](Affective-Sovereignty.tex). A GitHub Actions workflow compiles the LaTeX document directly to PDF and publishes the results to the repository root.

The generated site contains an `index.html` in the repository root that links to the PDF and embeds it in an iframe for convenient viewing. Pushes to `main` rebuild the PDF.
