# Affective Sovereignty

This repository hosts notes on a hypothetical agent architecture. The main specification lives in [Affective-Sovereignty.md](Affective-Sovereignty.md). A GitHub Actions workflow automatically converts that document to LaTeX and PDF and publishes the results to the repository root.

The generated site contains an `index.html` in the repository root that links to the PDF and embeds it in an iframe for convenient viewing. Pushes to `main` rebuild the PDF.
